## Win Conditions for Success-Critical Stakeholders

### Professor Mattingly (CEO)
- The customer service process is structured. "Requests" are tracked according to status as follows.
1. Request received
2. Problem confirmed
3. Fix defined
4. Fix implemented
5. Fix confirmed

Each request should move through these statuses in order, without any skipping steps. It will be necessary at times to jump back to an earlier step. We need to keep a full history of status changes with date, new status, who changed it, and comments.

### David Magda (Project Manager)
