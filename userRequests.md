We want to alter [this](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/publications/library/proceedings/lisa99/full_papers/limoncelli/limoncelli_html/index.html) document to fit our needs. We may or may not need all of the steps depending on how the customer service application is going to be executed.
We will want to follow a strict guideline on how to handle the requests from the start rather than trying to catch up later.

Currently, there are 9 steps in 4 phases: 

    Phase A: The Greeting ("Hello")
        Step 1: The Greeting 
    Phase B: Problem Identification ("What's wrong?")
        Step 2: Problem Classification
        Step 3: Problem Statement
        Step 4: Problem Verification 
    Phase C: Planning and Execution ("Fix it")
        Step 5: Solution Proposals
        Step 6: Solution Selection
        Step 7: Execution 
    Phase D: Verification ("Verify it")
        Step 8: Craft verification
        Step 9: User Verification/Closing.
